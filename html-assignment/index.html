                    About Me
                </h2>

                        <p>My name is Ivy. I moved to Ottawa from Guelph. I speak two languages fluently: Cantonese and English. I like to be creative in my free time, but a general lack of motivation sometimes hinders that. <abbr title="Rest In Peace">RIP.</abbr> I have tried a plethora of art mediums: needle felting, gouche, watercolour, acrylic, oil, clay, paper sculpture, etc. I like to brag that I have made a couple hundred dollars in cash from selling my art. It's one of the quite few interesting points in my life, and I was proud of my work. I like to make realistic paintings like recreating the Hubble Ultra Deep Field image, which was the 1<sup>ST</sup> painting I sold.</p>

                        <p>I love detail, so I also love making models. Recently, I have been really into Metal Earth and wooden model building. Listening to my records while sitting down and constructing these puzzles is really fun for me. I also have a shared cube collection with my partner, which I enjoy. Though, 10x10 is a little time-consuming. We also have board games like Catan, Joking Hazard, and Trial by Trolley. My hobbies are probably the <em>coolest</em> things I own.</p>
